> 🚧 **This library is an early work in progress! Breaking changes may be frequent.**

> 🐍 For Python 3.10+
No-boilerplate, async and typed Twitter access. 😋

```shell
pip install slytwitter
```

This library does not have full coverage.
Version 2 and premium version 1.1 are not supported.
Currently, the following topics are supported:

* Posting and managing tweets, with media
* Reading followers

You can directly grant user tokens using the command line, covering the whole OAuth 1.0 grant process.

Example usage:

```python
import asyncio
from SlyTwitter import *

async def main():
    # don't forget to keep your secrets secret!
    app = json.load(open('test/app.json'))
    user = json.load(open('test/user.json'))

    twitter = await Twitter(app, user)

    tweet = await twitter.tweet('Hello, world!')

    print(tweet)
    
asyncio.run(main())
```
